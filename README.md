# Welcome to the Arena
The Arena is a 4 player, free-for-all shooter game written in Javascript using the HTML5 canvas, with a custom built server written in Python at the backend. It's fast paced fun for your local network.

## How to play (v1.0a)
1. You must have python3.x installed on your machine, and it helps to run the server on a Linux machine
  * We have done no testing with regard to Windows hosting
2. Download the latest releases [here (v1.0a)](https://github.com/CompSci2k18/Arena/releases)
3. Extract the code from the downloaded archives
4. Navigate to your extracted code and run the server file (server.py)
5. Go to cs1.ucc.ie/~cb16/arena/ (should be changed) and choose Join Game.
6. Type in a username, the ip and port that were printed out by your server file and you're all set :)
