    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        It's buggy as all hell, but at this stage I don't care. It works.
        This was an experiment. To see if I could make a terrible online game,
        and as you will see, I suceeded. I hope to work out the kinks as I go
        but for all intents and purposes the game actually runs
    </p>
    <h3>NOTE - As of right now (6/10/16), this game is only compatible with Chrome</h3>
    <p>Maybe in the future I'll make it cross platform, but right now I'm just happy it kinda works :)</p>
