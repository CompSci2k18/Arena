Conversion to WebSockets:
    1. Add a websocket to the arena.js file
    2. Add WebSocket Frame encoding and decoding to the server
    3. Add a handshaking phase to the server
        - During this phase all players should attempt to handshake with the server
        - Once a player has successfully shaken hands, the websocket will wait for a message
        - Once all players have shaken hands, server runs gameStartUp
    4. Change the functionality of gameStartUp so that it sends the player data to each player as soon as it's needed
    5. Once the player receives this message, change the receive message function to run update, and the updatePlayers function to send the current player
