# Arena: A Game of Tanks
Arena is a 2 - 4 player browser based shoot-em-up, written in JavaScript with a custom written Python3 server.  
It's fast-paced fun for your local network.  

All you need is a browser and Python3.4 or greater. Running your server is easy;
    ```python3 ArenaGUI.py``` will provide you with a GUI  

A basic CLI version is now available, use ```python3 ArenaGUI.py --help``` for more info.
_We will be improving this at a later stage_
