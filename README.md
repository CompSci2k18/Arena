#Modules
There are 4 modules that I can see in this project. They are as follows;
1. Server Browser
2. Game Backend
3. Game Client
4. Auth / Player Profiles

Each of these modules has their own branch and projects page.
When you've been invited to the organisation and repo, go to the project page for the module(s) you want to help out in and add a note with your name to the column labelled People working on this module.

The project pages are used to keep everything together for each module, to post notes to the team and stuff like that.
